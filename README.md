- Complete Git workflow documentation
- Automated execution scripts for Windows and Linux/Mac

## Files in This Repository
- `calculator.py` - Simple Python calculator with basic arithmetic functions
- `README.md` - This documentation file (target for merge conflicts)
- `git-merge-conflict-workflow.md` - Detailed step-by-step workflow guide
- `execute-git-workflow.bat` - Automated Windows execution script

- `manual-steps-summary.md` - Quick reference guide

## Usage
Run `python calculator.py` to test the calculator functions.

## Git Workflow Demonstration
This project shows how to:
1. Create branches from different commit points
2. Intentionally create merge conflicts by editing the same line
3. Manually resolve conflicts using Git commands
4. Maintain clean commit history

## Execution
- **Windows:** Run `execute-git-workflow.bat`
- **Linux/Mac:** Run `./execute-git-workflow.sh`
- **Manual:** Follow steps in `git-merge-conflict-workflow.md`

## Learning Objectives
This repository demonstrates Git merge conflict resolution for educational purposes and assignment completion.
